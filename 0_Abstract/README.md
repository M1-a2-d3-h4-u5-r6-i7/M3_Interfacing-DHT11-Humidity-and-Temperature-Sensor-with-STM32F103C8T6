## Abstract



DHT11 is a Temperature and humidity sensor which as the name implies is used to measure the atmospheric temperature and humidity in a particular environment or in a confined closed space. The sensor is commonly used in monitoring environmental parameters in many applications like Agriculture, Food Industries, Hospitals, Automobile, Weather Stations etc.

The sensor could measure the temperature from 0°C to 50°C with an accuracy of 1°C. It is commonly used in controlled environments such as Heat ventilation systems, temperature chambers etc to monitor temperature and take corrective measures. The measuring range of humidity is from 20% to 90% with an accuracy of 1%. Humidity indicates the amount of water vapor present in the air. The value of humidity has to be kept within a controlled range in many scenarios like in manufacturing and storing of tea powders the correct humidity must be maintained in the room or the tea will lose its taste and smell. The level of humidity in living rooms should also be maintained within a comfortable range. The ideal value of humidity for maximum comfort is between 50% to 65%.

Today in this tutorial we will learn how to interface the popular DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor with STM32 microcontroller. We have already learnt the basics of STM32 board and how to use it Arduino IDE. For those who are new, the STM32 a.k.a BluePill development board, consists of the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller from ST Microelectronics. It is a 32-bit ARM Cortex M3 controller with high clock frequency suitable for high speed and power constraint application
